Given your partition setup, where `/dev/sda5` is your ext4 root partition and `/dev/sda6` is your FAT32 EFI partition, you can follow these steps to attempt to repair the GRUB bootloader. This process involves mounting these partitions and then installing GRUB properly. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Boot from Linux Mint Installation USB**: Restart your computer and boot from the Linux Mint installation USB to access a live session.

2. **Open a Terminal**: Once you are in the Linux Mint live environment, open a terminal.

3. **Mount the Root Partition**:
   - Mount your root partition (which is `/dev/sda5` in your case): 
     ```
     sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt
     ```

4. **Mount the EFI Partition**:
   - Mount your EFI partition (which is `/dev/sda6` in your case) to the correct directory:
     ```
     sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/boot/efi
     ```

5. **Mount Virtual Filesystems**:
   - Execute the following commands to mount the necessary virtual filesystems:
     ```
     sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
     sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts
     sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
     sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
     ```

6. **Chroot into Your System**:
   - Change root into your system:
     ```
     sudo chroot /mnt
     ```

7. **Install and Update GRUB**:
   - Now, install GRUB to the EFI partition. Since your system is UEFI-based, use the following command:
     ```
     grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=Linux Mint
     ```
   - After installing GRUB, update it:
     ```
     update-grub
     ```

8. **Exit and Reboot**:
   - Exit from the chroot environment:
     ```
     exit
     ```
   - Then, reboot your system:
     ```
     sudo reboot
     ```

9. **Check Boot Options**:
   - After rebooting, check your systemâ€™s boot options. You should now have an option to boot into Linux Mint and hopefully Windows as well.
   - If Windows is not listed, you might need to update GRUB again from within your Linux Mint installation, or in some cases, repair the Windows bootloader using Windows recovery tools.
