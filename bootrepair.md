If updating GRUB didn't reveal the Windows boot option, there are a few other methods you can try from within Linux Mint to resolve this issue. It's important to proceed with caution and ensure that you have backups of your important data.

### 1. Re-Check GRUB Configuration

First, double-check your GRUB configuration:

- Open Terminal.
- Edit the GRUB configuration file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/default/grub
  ```
- Ensure that the line `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false` is present and not commented out (no `#` at the beginning). If it's not there, add it.
- Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).
- Update GRUB again:
  ```bash
  sudo update-grub
  ```

### 2. Manually Add Windows to GRUB

If the OS prober doesn't find Windows, you can manually add it to the GRUB menu:

- First, find out where Windows is installed. You can use `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, or GParted to identify the Windows partition.
- Then, create a custom menu entry for Windows. Edit the custom GRUB file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom
  ```
- Add the following lines, replacing `hd0,gpt1` with the correct identifiers for your Windows EFI partition (usually the EFI partition is the first partition on the first drive, hence `hd0,gpt1`):
  ```
  menuentry "Windows 10" {
      insmod part_gpt
      insmod fat
      insmod chain
      set root='(hd0,gpt1)'
      chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
  }
  ```
- Save and exit.
- Update GRUB:
  ```bash
  sudo update-grub
  ```

### 3. Check EFI Partitions

- Ensure that your EFI partition is healthy and properly configured. The EFI partition is typically a FAT32 partition with a size around 100-500 MB.
- Make sure it's mounted correctly and contains the Windows bootloader files. You can mount and explore it using the file manager or command line.

### 4. Use Boot-Repair

- If manual methods don't work, consider using the Boot-Repair tool. It's a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues.
- Install Boot-Repair in Mint:
  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair
  boot-repair
  ```
- Run Boot-Repair and use the Recommended repair option. This can often resolve dual-boot issues automatically.

### 5. Windows Bootloader Issues

- If none of these steps work, the issue might lie with the Windows bootloader itself.
- Consider using a Windows recovery disk to repair the Windows bootloader. This won't affect your Linux installation but will repair any issues with Windows boot files.

### 6. Seek Assistance

- If you're still having trouble, consider seeking assistance from Linux Mint or Windows forums, where users with similar hardware configurations may have found specific solutions.
- Local tech support or a professional with experience in dual-boot systems can also be a valuable resource.

Always proceed carefully when modifying boot configurations, as incorrect settings can complicate boot issues further.
